# 🆔 Event ID 4624: An account was successfully logged on

### 📝 Description
This event is generated when a logon session is created. It is recorded on the target computer that was accessed.

### 🔍 Key Fields to Monitor
| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Logon Type** | Specifies how the user logged on (Local, Network, RDP). |
| **TargetUserName** | The name of the user who logged on. |
| **IpAddress** | The source IP address of the logon attempt. |
| **Logon ID** | A unique ID used to correlate this logon with other events. |

### 🛠️ Common Logon Types
- **Type 2 (Interactive):** Physical logon (keyboard/monitor).
- **Type 3 (Network):** Accessing a shared folder or printer.
- **Type 10 (RemoteInteractive):** Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

### ⚔️ Attack Scenario: Lateral Movement
An attacker steals credentials and uses them to move from a compromised workstation to a server via RDP.
- **Evidence:** A `Logon Type 10` event with a suspicious source `IpAddress` and an administrative `TargetUserName`.

### 🛡️ Detection Logic
* **Alert on:** Any `Logon Type 10` (RDP) attempts outside of business hours.
* **Alert on:** Multiple successful logons from the same IP address using different usernames within a short timeframe.
