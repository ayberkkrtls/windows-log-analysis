# Event ID 1102: The audit log was cleared

### Description
This event is generated when the Windows Security audit log is cleared. This is often a sign of an attacker trying to hide their tracks after a compromise.

### Key Fields to Monitor
| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **SubjectUserName** | The user who cleared the log. |
| **SubjectDomainName** | The domain of the user. |

### Attack Scenario: Anti-Forensics
An attacker completes their objectives (exfiltrating data) and runs `wevtutil cl security` to delete all evidence of their activities.
- **Evidence:** A single 1102 event generated by a privileged user or a suspicious service account.

### Detection Logic
* **Critical Alert:** Any occurrence of Event ID 1102 should be treated as a high-severity incident.
* **Investigation:** Immediately investigate what the `SubjectUserName` was doing 15-30 minutes before this event occurred.
